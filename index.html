                    <p>An advertiser isn’t limited to any number of verticals. It could be a shopping app, a strategy
                      game or any other brand.
                      The common factor is that all advertisers have a message they want to deliver to users.
                      Advertisers are not to be
                      confused with publishers: a publisher owns the space to display an advertiser’s message. For
                      example, let’s say you see
                      an ad on Instagram (the publisher) for new sneakers (a product belonging to the advertiser).
                    </p>
                    <h5>What is the difference between an advertiser and an advertising agency?</h5>
                    <p>Advertising agencies help companies create, plan and distribute their advertising campaigns. An
                      agency can offer
                      specialist knowledge in the areas of creative design, user experience, and digital marketing, with
                      further
                      specializations in different types of media. This can range from mobile and TV to web and print.
                      When distinguishing the
                      difference between an agency and an advertiser, remember that agencies are hired to help companies
                      determine the voice,
                      language, and style of their ads.</p>

                    <p>Cost Per Action (CPA) Marketing is a affiliate model where a commission is paid when a user takes

                  <p>CPM stands for cost per thousand impressions and is typically used in measuring how many thousands

                    advertising or marketing piece has (hopefully!) left an impression on.

                    CPM is typically used in campaigns that are designed to be seen by thousands of thousands of people.
                    Here’s a look at
                    how this actually works, which kind of campaigns it works best in, and where the results come from.
                    We will also touch
                    on how CPM relates to digital marketing and how it fits into a wider company marketing strategy.</p>
